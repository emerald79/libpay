TODOs:
- Compile out logging at level trace and below when not building in debug mode.
- Tag information (format, template, size, etc.) for all EMV and proprietary
  tags.
- Memory Leaks (Reference counting in TLV node objects?)
- Supported Currency Codes
- Generic LT state machine in checker (or move LT state into LT ??)
- Test cases 2ED.012.[00|02|04|06|08|11|13|15] changed from v2.4a to v2.5a, but
  i don't understand the rationale.  For now, libpay remains at the v2.4a
  version.
